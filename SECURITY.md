## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you think you have discovered a security issue in any of Soramitsu projects, please let us know. We take all security bugs seriously and if confirmed upon investigation we will patch it as soon as possible and release a public security bulletin discussing the impact and crediting the discoverer. Reporting a security weakness is easy - just email us a description of the flaw and any related information (e.g. reproduction steps, version) at security@soramitsu.co.jp
