## Project deploy info
There is `public/env.json` file which contains `BASE_API_URL` and `DEFAULT_NETWORKS` variables.

`BASE_API_URL` will be used for the address of the current stand.

`DEFAULT_NETWORKS` variable has the following format:

```
"DEFAULT_NETWORKS": [
    {
        "chain": "SORA-staging Testnet",
        "name": "SORA",
        "address": "wss://ws.stage.sora2.soramitsu.co.jp"
    }
]
```

`"chain"` is used as the chain name.
`"name"` is used as the node name.
`"address"` is used for the address of the node to which the frontend project will be connected.

`DEFAULT_NETWORKS[0]` must be a Soramitsu trusted node. App used it's `genesisHash` to check custom user node for connection

`CHAIN_GENESIS_HASH` should be defined for 'prod' & 'stage' environments, to not polling nodes for getting it (because genesis hash for these env's not changing).

## How to add translations?
1) Add your translations to `src/lang/messages.ts`.
2) Run script to generate `en.json` file from `src/lang/messages.ts`. This will update `en.json` file with new translations, arranged in alphabetical order.
```
yarn lang:generate
```
3) Load updated `en.json` file to `Lokalise`.
4) Add translations for other languages in `Localise`.
5) Download translations from `Localise`, update these files in project.
6) Run script to order translations alphabetical in `en.json` file (Localise has it's own translations order).
```
yarn lang:fix
```
